#  Introduction
- **NAME**:ARYAN
- **AGE**:19

## Education: Double the Degree, Double the Struggle

- Pursuing a **B.Tech** and a **BS in Data Science** i.e *online* degree but **exams are offline** from IIT Madras .
- Completed the first year (foundation) of both degrees.
- Joined the bs program because, who wouldn't love the IIT tag? 😅

## 💻 Languages & Tools

- 🐍 First language: `Python` — Started my programming journey with Python and have built a solid grip on it over time.
- 📚 Currently doing `DSA` in `C++`
- 🧠 Learning: `Data Science`, `Machine Learning`

## 🤷‍♂️ Why DSA?

Honestly? I'm not aiming for LeetCode king status.  
But it's part of my B.Tech syllabus — so here I am, battling arrays and pointers like a warrior.

## 🎯 My Goal

I'm aiming to contribute to **GSoC 2026** with projects in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I'll be using my GitHub to share what I learn along the way.
